# About me

Hi, I'm Annlee Fores a hardware enthusiast and developer. My main goals are to spread maker/hacker culture among the upcoming generation. I invariably try to do the same by teaming up with communities like Hack Club, IEEE, IEDC in helping organize hackathons, workshops, makerfests.
I am currently in my sophomore year at the College of Engineering Thalassery pursuing my Electronics and Communication undergraduate degree. 
I started my journey by writing about my projects on [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com). Soon this became a passion. I got into a whole new world of sharing. Since then I moved on to [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io) to author my projects. Hackster.io gave me plenty of exposure to the tech world. The passion generated by writing tutorials on DIY websites led to my interest in establishing a maker culture.
As of now I'm working with Hack Club to spread the magical powers of coding.
